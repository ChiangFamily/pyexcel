Introduction
-------------

**pyexcel** provides **one** application programming interface to read,
manipulate and write data in different excel formats. This library makes
information processing involving excel files an enjoyable task. The data in
excel files can be turned into :ref:`array or dict<a-list-of-data-structures>`
with least code, vice versa. And ready-made custom :ref:`filters<filters>`
and :ref:`formatters<formatters>` can be applied. This library focuses on data
processing using excel files as storage media hence fonts, colors and charts
were not and will not be considered.

Excel files are de-facto file format for information sharing in non-software
centric organisations. Excel files are not only used for mathematical
computation in financial institutions but also used for many other purposes
in an office work environment. This is largely casued by wide adoption of
Microsoft Office. Comparing the existing, mathematics savvy Pandas library,
this library intends to help data processing job where data extraction is more
important than data analysis. In such context, ease of use, and low overhead is
preferred, while Pandas is as big as 4MB and contains hundreds of potentially
useful functions.

Usage
------

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> import pyexcel.ext.xls
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")

Suppose you want to process the following excel data :

========= ====
Name      Age
========= ====
Adam      28
Beatrice  29
Ceri      30
Dean      26
========= ====

Here are the example usages:

.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> import pyexcel.ext.xls # import it to handle xls file
   >>> import pyexcel.ext.xlsx # import it to handle xlsx file
   >>> records = pe.get_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26

.. testcode::
   :hide:
   
   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")
